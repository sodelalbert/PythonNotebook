"""
1. Keep classes small - data focused, behaviour focused

For this example you can see Stats, Address and Person class. Person uses Stats and Address as extenstion.

2. Make classes easy to use by leveraging @properties and dunder methods

3. classes are required if we NEED to use multiple instances of them. If this is not the case modules might be better.
